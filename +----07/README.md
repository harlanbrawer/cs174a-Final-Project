Group Members:
Harlan Brawer
	Created the base game, ball, grid and camera. Created the ball physics and movement system, the camera movement system, the grid randomization, respawn and movement system, the collision detection, and movement controller/input.
Max Zhang
	Created the scene transitions and scoring. Created the entirety of the score system including the numbers that update in the top right and the counting. Also created all scene transitions including the opening (and skip feature) and the ending that includes the exploding earth. Created the final video for submission.
Colton Meskell
	Handled all textureing of the ball and grid. Figured out a difficult bug in texturing the grid squares. Implemented randomization of the grid texture and created the space background for the game.

A cube runner type game where you use the force to control the Earth to dodge incoming asteroids and projectiles. You gain score for dodging grids of projectiles. The game ends upon collision with any of the projectiles. The earth is controlled with i,j,k,l.
